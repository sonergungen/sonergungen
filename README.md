<h1> I'm Soner 🌎 🔭 ✨ </h1>

I'm an astronomer at Ege University, Department of Astronomy and Space Sciences in Izmir. 
I work on detecting and characterizing possible influence of planets 🌎 on solar activity 🌕. 
And, I'm teaching astronomy for students living in disadvantaged areas in Izmir. 
And so, I'm developing an online platform about astronomy that includes 
courses 📝, activities 🔔, applications 🌟,  workshops 🌙, games 🎮, current sciences news 🚀 
and users can create and share their own content.
